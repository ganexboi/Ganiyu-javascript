        <h1> Overview of each of ECMAscricpt version from ES1 to ES6</h1>
        <ol>
            <li class="li">ECMAScript 1 </li> <br>
            <p> ES1 was released in 1997 <br><br>
                This was the first standardized version of JavaScript, formalizing the language that Netscape had
                initially developed to ensure that web developers could use JavaScript across different browsers. <br>
                <br>
                Few features are :<br> Introduced basic structures such as functions, loops, conditionals, and core
                objects like Object, Array, Date, and Math. <br>
                Syntax for handling basic types (e.g., numbers, strings, booleans). <br>
                Focused on DOM interaction and simple web interactivity.
            </p>


            <li class="li">ECMAScript 2</li>
            <p>It was released in 1998 <br>
                This was a minor update that didn’t introduce any new language features but was important for making
                ECMAScript compliant with the ISO/IEC 16262* standard. <br>
                Key Features: No new functionality, mainly a cleanup of ECMAScript 1 and alignment with international
                standards.



            </p>


            <li class="li">ECMAScript 3</li>
            <p> ES3 was released in 1999 <br><br>
                This version was a major update that significantly expanded the language's capabilities, setting the
                foundation for many modern JavaScript features. <br>
                Main features are: <br>
                Regular expressions: Introduced pattern matching within strings, making text processing easier. <br>
                Error handling (try/catch): Added structured error handling, enabling developers to manage errors
                better. <br>
                String methods: Added methods like replace(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), and split() for easier
                string manipulation. <br>
                Array enhancements: Added methods like push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() to make arrays more
                flexible. <br>
                Control structures: Added features like switch statements and do-while loops for improved control
                flow. <br>
            </p>



            <li class="li">ECMAScript 4 </li>
            <p>ES 4 was cancelled due to the complexity and disagrement among major stake holders <br>
                ES 4 was proposed to be released in the early 2000s <br>
                ES4 was supposed to introduce large-scale enhancements to the language, such as static typing, classes,
                and modules. However, it was abandoned due to disagreements between browser vendors and concerns about
                backward compatibility <br>
                Planed Key Features : <br>
                Classes: Would have introduced a formal class syntax (which was later included in ES6). <br>
                Modules: Planned module system to organize and reuse code (also later included in ES6). <br>
                Types: Optional static typing for more robust code. <br>
                Generators and iterators: Early ideas for working with sequences of values, similar to what was
                eventually introduced in later versions.


            </p>


            <li class="li">ECMAScript 5</li>
            <p> It was released in December 2009 <br>
                The significance of ES5 was a update that focused on improving the reliability and usability of
                JavaScript, as well as enhancing features for modern web development. <br>
                Few Key Features: <br> <br>
                Strict mode: Added "use strict"; mode to catch common coding mistakes (like undeclared variables),
                preventing potentially dangerous actions. <br>
                JSON support*: Added native JSON parsing (JSON.parse()) and serialization (JSON.stringify()), which
                became crucial for working with APIs and modern web applications.

            </p>


            <li class="li"> ECMAScript 6</li>
            <p> It was released in june 2015 <br>
                Significance: ES6, this version was a huge leap forward and is considered
                the most important update since ECMAScript 3. <br>
                ES6 introduced modern programming features, making JavaScript a much more powerful language for
                large-scale applications. <br>
                ECMAScript 6 (ES6), also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced significant improvements like arrow
                functions, promises, modules, classes, and template literals. <br>
                -ES6 marked a turning point for JavaScript, making it more suitable for complex application
                development.


            </p>
        </ol>

        <h3> Summary </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ES1 to ES3: Standardization and foundational features.
            </li>
            <li>ES4: Canceled due to complexity.
            </li>
            <li> ES5: Improved reliability with strict mode, better object manipulation, and native JSON support.
            </li>
            <li>ES6: Major upgrade with new syntax (classes, arrow functions), asynchronous programming support
                (promises), modules, and more efficient ways to handle data (destructuring, rest/spread operators). This
                version shaped modern JavaScript development.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <strong style="justify-content: center;">NOTE: ES6 is considered a turning point for JavaScript, making it a
            much more powerful and versatile
            language, capable of handling complex applications both on the client and server-side.</strong>
